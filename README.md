This repository houses Antithesis, my investigation into the reverse-engineering of synthesized sounds using machine learning.

## Introduction
Electronic music producers use synthesizers to craft sounds that we hear in modern music. Being able to hear a sound and recreate it on a synthesizer is a hard task that generally takes a music producer years of experience to master. Perhaps modern machine learning techniques can be used to "hear" such sounds and predict the parameters that created it in a given synth.
