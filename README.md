This repository houses Antithesis, my investigation into the reverse-engineering of synthesized sounds using machine learning.

## Introduction
Electronic music producers use synthesizers to craft sounds that we hear in variety of genres, such as house, dubstep, and even modern pop. Being able to hear a sound and recreate it on a synthesizer is a hard task that generally takes a music producer/sound designer years of experience to master. In some ways, it is analagous to being able to hear a melody and chords and being able to reproduce it on a keyboard by ear.
