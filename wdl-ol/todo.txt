iplug-todo

ALL - make side chain/multi-channel definitions more consistent and more flexible, i.e. mono or stereo SC
ALL - lock free-ness
ALL - GetHostVersionStr() etc are not reliable, especially with AU
ALL - more flexible resource importing (not just png resources)
ALL - improve text entry dimensions / text size
ALL - freetype based font renderer, import .ttf files
ALL - drag & drop area
ALL - OS tooltips?
ALL - carbon non-composited text entry
ALL - carbon non-composited doesn't just draw the dirty area of the GUI, it always redraws the entire GUI
ALL - Sysex?

Examples:

- IPlugPolySynth - needs improvement
- IPlugDrumSynth
- IPlugMultiChannel - standalone app doesn't work, due to stereo limitation
- IPlugOpenGL - drawing not implemented on win
- IPlugControls - some controls not finished
- IPlugEEL - not finished

AU wrapper:

- preset changing from inside the plugin doesn't consistently update logic's GUI
- auval "preset name not retained" message
- SendMidiMsg() not implemented
- possibility of instruments with multichannel output, e.g. 5.1
- possibility of instruments with side-chain inputs

VST3 wrapper:

- SendMidiMsg()
- pitch bend & other common MIDI CC parameters

RTAS wrapper:

- "continuous" gui controls linked to enumerated list parameters jump around
- multi-mono with PLUG_DOES_STATE_CHUNKS 1 doesn't sync instances (likely PT issue)
- auxiliary output stems for instruments with multiple outs
- keycatcher doesn't work (OSX)
- text entries disabled (OSX)
- audiosuite
- presets list
- close session frozen buffer (only happens when debugging?)
- SendMidiMsg/s

AAX wrapper:

- "continuous" gui controls linked to enumerated list parameters jump around
- multi-mono with PLUG_DOES_STATE_CHUNKS 1 doesn't sync instances
- auxiliary output stems for instruments with multiple outs
- SendMidiMsg/s

Standalone wrapper:

- edit to use IPlugBase buffer attaching code
- some keys not received by windows standalone...arrow keys for example DLGC_WANTARROWS
- how to change audio devices without hanging the main loop?
- fade out audio stream when changing settings?
- make it work with no audio input & look at PLUG_IS_INST
- make it work with variable i/o count
- make it work with non-gui plugins
- transport & tempo generator
- missing functions in IPlugStandalone.h
- windows midi - sendmidimsg() crash
- windows midi - MS Built in GS Synth crashes when selected in prefs (XP)
- state persistence - save fxp & option
- look again at JACK client osx
- get latency and display
- improve MIDI output timing (portmidi instead of RTMidi?)

IOS wrapper:

- edit to use IPlugBase buffer attaching code
- make it work better on device
- see if it works with IOS 5 sdk / float remoteIO
